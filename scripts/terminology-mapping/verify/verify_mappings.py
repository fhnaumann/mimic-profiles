"""Verify the generated ConceptMap / ValueSet pairs and the stream artefacts.

This is what you read before deciding to publish. It re-derives NO mapping: no
dot rules, no code conversion, no "is this code in that release" logic. Those
live once, in conceptmaps/lib/. This reads the generated artefacts and checks
properties of them.

Discovery, not a registry
-------------------------
The maps are found by globbing `conceptmaps/build_*_cm_vs.py` and reading each
module's FIELD / SOURCES / META; the streams come from lib/streams.py, the one
place they are declared. Adding a map or a stream needs no edit here.

Checks
------
1. Stream coverage. Every code in each stream's enumeration is either mapped by
   every consuming ConceptMap or listed in unmapped-<stream>.csv — and the
   map's `unmatched` entries and the CSV must agree, or one of them is stale.

2. ValueSet == ConceptMap target side. The value set is the map's
   targetCanonical, so "member of the value set" and "reachable by $translate"
   must be the same set.

3. Every (system, version) the artefacts reference is one we actually built.
   Systems on UNVERSIONED_SYSTEMS may legitimately pin nothing.

4. No code maps to an ICD-10-PCS grouper. 64 of MIMIC's 2,544 ICD-9 procedure
   codes are verbatim valid 4-character PCS body-part groupers; such a mapping
   would point a procedure at an anatomical structure AND make the unmapped
   report read zero.

5. Completeness against the BINDING. Every code the element's bound ValueSet
   admits has an entry in the ConceptMap — mapped or `unmatched`. Check 1
   cannot catch a population the builder never declared; this reads the
   binding's own code list from occurrences/elements.json instead.

6. (folded into 5's warning) The bound facade ValueSets must be readable in the
   IG snapshot; said out loud instead of passing silently. They are the
   FSH-authored half of ig-resources/, so before the snapshot existed this meant
   "`sushi .` has not run" — now it means the snapshot is incomplete, which
   `make verify-ig` diagnoses precisely.

7. Stream <-> map agreement. Every ConceptMap consuming a stream carries the
   IDENTICAL answers for that stream's codes — same target system, same target
   code. A stream resolves once (lib/assemble.py); two maps disagreeing means
   an artefact is stale, which is exactly what a partial rebuild can produce.

8. Partition disjointness. Streams sharing a source system must not overlap:
   an overlapping code would belong to two streams, be counted twice in every
   statistic, and could be published with two different targets.

9. Partition COVERAGE — the other half of 8. Every code any binding admits must
   belong to some stream. Disjointness stops the registry double-counting;
   nothing stopped it under-counting by simply not mentioning a population, and
   that failure is silent where an overlap is not: a stream that does not exist
   writes no row, no worklist and no warning. Check 5 catches this per MAP, so
   it is blind to an element with no builder at all — which is exactly where
   both undeclared populations were found. Counted as unmapped codes rather
   than a FAIL: an undeclared population is a data gap of the same kind the
   worklists record, not a defect in what was built.

Exits non-zero when any code is unmapped or any invariant fails.
--allow-unmapped downgrades the unmapped count to a warning once you have
reviewed the CSVs; it does NOT relax the correctness checks.
