"""Every mapping stream, declared exactly once.

A STREAM is one source enumeration resolved into one or more target systems by
exactly one resolver — a committed table, a notation rule, or identity. It is
the unit the statistics are keyed by, the unit a generator regenerates, and the
unit a worklist (unmapped-<stream>.csv) is written for.

The stream key is the ENUMERATING IG RESOURCE, not the source CodeSystem. For
most streams the two coincide: the ValueSets bound over the MIMIC CodeSystems
are bare composes enumerating nothing, so the CodeSystem is the only
enumeration there is. `mimic-d-items` is the exception that forces the general
rule: one CodeSystem partitioned across three subset ValueSets, each mapped
from its own table into its own target system. Keyed by CodeSystem those would
be one stream with three tables and two target vocabularies — a number that
describes nothing. Keyed by enumeration they are the three streams the three
committed tables already are.

Names follow the committed tables (and their generation logs, and the `make`
targets): `d-items-snomed.csv` -> stream `d-items`, `labevents-loinc.csv` ->
`labevents`. Streams with no table (notation, identity) are named for their
enumerating resource.

WHY A REGISTRY, when this repo's stance is that a hand-kept list is the thing a
glob exists to avoid. That stance is about CONSUMER lists — "which fields share
this table" stays discovered, from which builders reference a stream name (see
lib/builders.py). A stream DECLARATION is the opposite case: before this file,
the same stream was declared once per consuming builder, and the duplicates
could disagree — mimic-medication-ndc was declared with a table in one builder
and without it in another, so the same Coding translated differently depending
on which element it sat on. One declaration, referenced by name, is the fix; a
builder naming an unknown stream is a hard error listing the real ones.

Streams sharing a source system must have pairwise-disjoint enumerations —
otherwise one code belongs to two streams and is counted twice, which is the
exact double-count this registry exists to end. check_disjoint() enforces it
and verify_mappings runs it.

DISJOINTNESS IS ONLY HALF THE INVARIANT. A registry that cannot double-count can
still under-count, by simply not mentioning a population — and the failure is
silent in a way an overlap is not, because a stream that does not exist writes no
row, no worklist and no warning. undeclared() is the other half: it reads the
bindings out of occurrences/elements.json, subtracts what the registry declares,
and hands back what is left, so build_stream_reports can give the gap a row in
the per-stream table (at 0% coverage, in the denominator) instead of leaving it
out of the numbers entirely. Adding a stream should be able to LOWER the headline
figure by revealing work; it must never RAISE it by revealing nothing.

_POE_IV_NOTE = (
    "Maps nothing by design. `IV therapy` and `TPN` are POE order flags, not "
    "substances, so no RxNorm concept exists for either at any term type — and "
    "a SNOMED procedure code, which does exist, would put a procedure in a "
    "column whose FHIRPath is medication[x] or Medication.code. The 0% is the "
    "honest result of a modelling defect one layer down, in the ETL, not of a "
    "mapping that failed. Every map whose binding admits these two codes "
    "declines them from this one shared table.")

_NDC_NOTE = (
    "The one stream in this repo with no model and no threshold: an NDC is a "
    "package identifier, not a label, and RxNorm publishes the mapping as a "
    "property. Two deterministic tiers — the NDC property, then the MIMIC "
    "label joined against the committed drug-name table — and a code either "
    "resolves through one of them or is declared. Where both tiers answer and "
    "disagree the NDC wins, because it is the manufacturer's own package "
    "identity rather than a free-text drug name; the label's answer is kept "
    "on the table row as `display_rxcui` so the disagreement stays auditable. "
    "Read a mapped target's specificity from its term type: the NDC tier "
    "gives the packaged product, the label tier only an ingredient-level "
    "generalisation.")

_ETC_NOTE = (
    "A therapeutic CLASS rather than a drug, which is why this is the one "
    "medication stream with no RxNorm target: RxNorm publishes no class "
    "concepts at any term type, and ATC — the natural target — is on no "
    "server this repo can reach. Mapped into SNOMED CT's substance hierarchy "
    "and not its medicinal-product hierarchy, because `<<763158003` contains "
    "no diuretic and no dihydropyridine concept whatsoever, which is 4.66% of "
    "the element's occurrences a product-only constraint could never reach. "
    "Consumers should read a target as 'the class of drug this record names', "
    "never as the drug: 57 of the 1,201 source codes are not medications at "
    "all (FDB files devices, supplies and bulk chemicals in the same column) "
    "and are declined, and one — `Chemicals - Solvents` — is a known accepted "
    "defect mapping to a laboratory reagent.")

_GSN_NOTE = (
    "The one medication stream a deterministic join mostly answers: the codes "
    "are FDB Generic Sequence Numbers and their displays are drug names, so "
    "61.4% of the enumeration (64.1% of the codings) resolves against the "
    "committed RxNorm term index with no model, no threshold and no judgement — "
    "including 2,137 displays in FDB's `generic [Brand]` form, which needs its "
    "own query rungs (lib/termindex.bracketed_rungs). Only the residual is "
    "asked of code-search. Two consequences for a consumer. Read a mapped "
    "target's specificity from its term type rather than assuming it: a label "
    "stating a strength and form reaches the clinical drug (`FoLIC Acid 1mg "
    "TAB` -> the 1 MG oral tablet), while a brand-only or ingredient-only "
    "label reaches only the ingredient, and a bracketed one is mapped to the "
    "GENERIC it names first, not to the brand. And this is the only medication "
    "stream with no SNOMED CT target at all, so a GSN code naming a drug class "
    "is declared rather than mapped into the substance hierarchy — an omission "
    "by decision, taken after that hierarchy answered `TAB A VITE` with a "
    "nerve agent.")

_UNITS_NOTE = (
    "Two populations in one CodeSystem, and they need reading apart. 92 of "
    "these codes are units MIMIC records on Observation.valueQuantity, "
    "carrying 182M occurrences, and they are ordinary clinical units spelled "
    "the way a chart spells them — `mmHg`, `mEq/L`, `bpm`, `cmH2O` — each with "
    "one unambiguous UCUM equivalent. The remaining ~413 are medication "
    "DOSAGE units, and about half of those are not units of measure at all: "
    "dose forms (`tab`, `vial`, `PUFF`), quantities that belong in a "
    "different field (`(1,000 mg)`, `mEq / 250 mL NS`), and ETL artefacts "
    "(`mg\\ 0 mg`, `Umits`, `tiwst`). Dose forms are mapped to the "
    "dimensionless UCUM annotation naming them; the rest are declined. "
    "VALIDITY OF THE SOURCE STRING IS NOT THE ORGANISING PRINCIPLE and a "
    "consumer must not treat it as one: `K/uL` on Platelet Count parses "
    "perfectly as KELVIN per microlitre, and `N/A` as newton per ampere, so "
    "four strings carrying 13M occurrences are valid UCUM meaning something "
    "other than what MIMIC intends. Those rows carry a comment, enforced by "
    "the generator wherever source and target differ in canonical dimension.")

_UNITS_NATIVE_NOTE = (
    "The units MIMIC's ETL had ALREADY normalised, which are not members of "
    "mimic-units and are reachable through no other stream. Where the ETL "
    "normalised a unit it wrote the UCUM expression into Quantity.code and "
    "named http://unitsofmeasure.org in Quantity.system, instead of writing "
    "the chart spelling under CodeSystem/mimic-units as it usually does — so "
    "these arrive already standard, and the identity is the honest answer. "
    "This is NOT the identity group build_units_cm_vs.py argues against: that "
    "argument is about the 87 mimic-units codes which happen to parse as UCUM, "
    "where the SYSTEM still changes and `mg/dL` -> `mg/dL` is therefore a real "
    "translation. Here the system does not change, because it was UCUM in the "
    "data to begin with. MEASURED, not assumed: the four codes are what the "
    "2026-08-20 full-warehouse run found on Observation.code and "
    "Observation.component.code, read from the declared Quantity.system rather "
    "than inferred from spelling. `mm[Hg]` (3,779,500 occurrences, the two "
    "blood pressure components) and `[degF]` (1,401,314, body temperature) had "
    "no answer at all before this stream. `/min` and `%` did resolve, but only "
    "because they are also mimic-units codes spelled identically to their own "
    "targets — a coincidence rather than a guarantee, and one a consumer "
    "cannot see, so they are declared here too. NOTE the spelling divergence "
    "this makes visible rather than causes: the table maps `bpm` -> "
    "`/min{beats}` and `insp/min` -> `/min{insp}`, deliberately annotated so "
    "heart rate stays distinguishable from respiratory rate, while the ETL "
    "wrote bare `/min` for both. Both answers are in the map because both "
    "spellings are in the data; the map reports that, it does not reconcile "
    "it.")
