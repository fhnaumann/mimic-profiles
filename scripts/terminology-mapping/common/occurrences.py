"""Weighting the mapping statistics by how much data each code carries.

Coverage over CODES answers "how much of the dictionary did we map". This module
adds coverage over OCCURRENCES, which answers "how likely is a data point I meet
to carry a code $translate cannot resolve" — and the two diverging is the
finding: 76% of the datetimeevents items mapped but 14% of the rows means the
items nurses touch every shift are the unmapped ones.

Everything here is offline. The counts come from a committed artifact extracted
once on the HPC node (occurrences/code-occurrences.csv, see its README); this
module joins them to the field reports and the IG's own enumerations, and
recomputes no mapping.

Three things are produced, in ascending order of how much they claim:

  per stream   the report's coverage_pct, re-weighted. Same numerator and
               denominator as the code count, each code counted as often as it
               occurs.

  per element  every occurrence of the element partitioned seven ways —
               MAPPED, DECLINED (a built stream considered it and said no, with
               a reason on record), BLOCKED (a built stream that maps nothing
               because the obstacle is outside terminology — an ETL or
               modelling defect), UNRESOLVED (a declared stream owns the code
               but has no answer for it yet), NO_MAP (a stream resolved it, but
               this element has no ConceptMap to serve the answer), NO_STREAM (a
               bound population NO stream declares at all), NOT_IN_ENUMERATION
               (a code in the data that no bound ValueSet admits, which under a
               required binding is an ETL or binding defect). Everything after
               DECLINED is kept apart from it on purpose: only DECLINED is a
               judgement this repo would defend, and reporting a backlog or a
               mis-modelled column as if it were one would misrepresent both.

               The three backlog buckets are split because they have three
               different fixes and one used to hide inside another: before the
               split, MedicationDispense.medication[x] reported 14,240,367
               occurrences as `no-stream-yet` when only 1,550,601 of them had no
               stream — the other 12.7M were streams that resolve perfectly,
               waiting on a ConceptMap for that element. Extending a table, ADDING
               a builder and DECLARING a stream are three different jobs, so they
               are three different buckets.

               BLOCKED is also what makes the element's coverage reportable two
               ways — against every occurrence, and against the occurrences a
               code system could ever have covered. See element_summary.

  top N        the most frequent codes with their status, which is where the
               divergence between the two percentages becomes readable: you look
               down the head of the distribution and see which heavy hitters are
               unmapped.

The stream -> code-set join reads the IG resource named in each stream's
`source_file` (added in lib/assemble.py). Attribution is by code membership, not
by source system: mimic-d-items serves three populations, so only the
enumerations can say which stream a given d-item belongs to.
