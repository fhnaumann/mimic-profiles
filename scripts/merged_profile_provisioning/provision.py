"""Apply a merged-profile terminology facade to FHIR resources whose sub-type
StructureDefinitions were collapsed into a single Delta table during data
preprocessing.

Background: preprocessing merges several MIMIC Observation sub-resources
(labevents, chartevents, vital-signs, ...) into one `Observation` resource
because Pathling requires a single resource type. Each sub-resource carried its
own `meta.profile` (a distinct StructureDefinition binding one ValueSet at
`Observation.code`). After the merge the table carries N distinct profiles, and
`code_mapping._resolve_profile` — which needs exactly one profile to anchor the
find-code binding — fails.

The merged StructureDefinition and its grouping ValueSet are NOT generated or
uploaded by this script. They are authored and published as ordinary IG
content (FSH) in the mimic-profiles repo — see
`input/fsh/SD_MimicObservationMerged.fsh` and
`input/fsh/VS_MimicObservationMerged.fsh` for the Observation example —
because this script has no business writing to the velonto terminology
server; that publication is the IG maintainer's responsibility via the IG's
own build/publish pipeline. This script only ever reads from the terminology
server (to verify what's already published, or to document what a merge
would need) and writes to the local Delta table.

This script has four modes:

  document   Read-only. Discover the sub-type profiles present in the data
             for --resource, resolve each one's `<Resource>.code` binding
             ValueSet from the terminology server, and write a JSON artifact
             (plus a suggested FSH draft) describing what the equivalent of
             `SD_Mimic<Resource>Merged.fsh` / `VS_Mimic<Resource>Merged.fsh`
             would need to contain for that resource. This is the discovery
             step for resources other than Observation — it never writes to
             the terminology server or to Delta; it only documents what a
             human then authors by hand in FSH. If --resource is omitted and
             --data is a warehouse root, every `<Resource>.parquet` table
             directly under it is swept in one run; resources whose data
             carries fewer than 2 distinct profiles (nothing to merge) are
             reported but skipped, no artifact written.

  data-map   Overwrite `meta.profile` on the merged Delta table so every row
             that carried one of the sub-type profiles now carries the single
             merged StructureDefinition URL (as published by the IG). In
             place; --dry-run reports the matched-row count and a before
             sample without writing. Runs identically whether --data points
             at local demo data or a full-MIMIC table on an isolated HPC node
             (no network access needed — this mode never talks to a FHIR
             server). If --resource is omitted and --data is a warehouse
             root, every `<Resource>.parquet` table directly under it is
             swept in one run, same as `document`.

  verify     Probe the data: print a small sample of `meta.profile` and, for
             each distinct profile present, resolve its StructureDefinition on
             the terminology server and print the `<Resource>.code` binding
             ValueSet (and whether that ValueSet itself resolves). Read-only,
             print-only — no writes. Run after `data-map` to confirm the rows
             now point at the merged StructureDefinition and that it binds
             `<Resource>.code` on the server as expected.

  import     Read-only w.r.t. Delta — never touches Spark/the local
             warehouse. Meant to run from a separate, network-connected
             machine after `data-map` has already remapped the data in place
             on the (possibly network-isolated) HPC node. Discovers which
             resources need importing by scanning the subfolders of
             --out-dir (the artifacts/ tree a prior `document` run wrote —
             one subfolder per resource that actually needed merging), builds
             a single FHIR `$import` request (inputFormat=Parquet,
             saveMode=overwrite, one input entry per discovered resource at
             `<--import-base-url>/<Resource>.parquet`), POSTs it to
             --pathling-url with `Prefer: respond-async`, and polls the
             status URL until the job completes. --dry-run prints the built
             request without POSTing.

The merged URLs are a pure function of (--base-url, --resource); --base-url
still defaults to the felix.masters scratch namespace rather than the IG's
real canonical (http://mimic.mit.edu/fhir/mimic) — a deliberate reminder that
this merged-profile facade is local tooling, not something published back to
the upstream MIMIC IG.

Example:
  # Sweep every resource in the warehouse at once.
  uv run python scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/provision.py \
    --mode document \
    --data /path/to/spark-warehouse \
    --out-dir scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/artifacts

  # Or just one resource.
  uv run python scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/provision.py \
    --resource Condition --mode document \
    --data /path/to/spark-warehouse/Condition.parquet \
    --out-dir scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/artifacts/Condition

  uv run python scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/provision.py \
    --resource Observation --mode data-map \
    --data /path/to/spark-warehouse/Observation.parquet \
    --dry-run

  # From a network-connected machine, after data-map ran on the HPC node:
  uv run python scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/provision.py \
    --mode import \
    --out-dir scripts/merged_profile_provisioning/artifacts \
